About Me

The ability to adapt is to be able to survive,
The ability to change is to be able to stand the test of time,
I'm still a student, taking one step at a time,
Gathering experiences as I spend my time.

Generally, I'm referred to as a jack of all trades and I always tend to seek out ways to improve my knowledge via training or certifications.
You can find me to be a bold, adventurous personality who values balance & equality whilst demonstrating a strong sense of duty and justice.
